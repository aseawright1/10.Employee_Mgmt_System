# 10.Employee_Management_System

## What this project is
This application prompts the user via command-line and allows them to choose between various options to manage their employee database. Users are able to view, update, and add new departments, roles, and employees to their database. The organizational structure follows the schema below:

## Why I began this project
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. This project's objective was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## How I implemented this project
This project was implemented using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3), and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## What I hope to eventually accomplish with this project
In future versions of the project I hope to add features allowing the user to update employee managers, view employees by their manager groups, delete departments/roles/employees, as well as see the total utilized budget of a department (ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department)
